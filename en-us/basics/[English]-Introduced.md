## Basic concepts in PlatONE
* **Nodes**

    The nodes in PlatONE mainly have the following types:

     + Observer node: This type of node is only responsible for synchronizing blocks, does not participate in the generation of blocks. There will always be several stable observer nodes in the system. It is used to synchronize block stably and is also used to be specified as bootnodes by other nodes to connect;

     + Consensus node: This type of node participates in the generation of blocks, and the synchronization of blocks;

* **Accounts**

    Compared to the account model, UTXO does not support smart contracts, and many DAG projects are actively exploring smart contracts, but there are no mature and stable solutions, so PlatONE chooses the mature and stable account model which supports smart contracts. In PlatONE, each account has a state and a 20-byte address associated with it. Accounts are divided into two categories:

    **Basic Accounts** are controlled by a private key, which can be generated by the user through the wallet client. In PlatONE, basic accounts can create transactions and sign them with the private key. In addition to basic accounts storing account balance, a smart contract can be authorized to extend and access custom attributes.

    **Contract Accounts** are controlled by code and do not have private keys. A contract account's address is generated when the contract is deployed. Unlike basic accounts, contract accounts cannot initiate new transactions on their own. Whenever a contract account receives a message, the code inside the contract is activated, allowing it to read and write to internal storage, and to send other messages or create contracts.

* **Smart Contracts**

    **Wasm Contracts** support high-level language development and compiles to executable Wasm. Transactions that trigger wasm contracts are packaged by the consensus nodes, and the nodes in the entire network repeat the verification. The statuses of the wasm contracts are saved to the public ledger.

    **Verifiable Contracts** are developed and published in the same way as wasm contracts; they also compile to executable Wasm. The state transitions of verifiable contracts are asynchronously executed by computation nodes off the chain. After a computation is completed, the new state and the state transition proof are submitted to the chain, and the entire network of nodes can quickly verify the correctness and update the new state to the public ledger. Verifiable contracts support complex, heavy computing logic without affecting the performance of the entire chain.

    **Privacy Contracts** also support high-level language development and compile to executable Intermediate Language (LLVM IR). The input data to privacy contracts is stored locally on data nodes. The data nodes perform private computation off the chain using secure multiparty computation, and submit the computation result to the chain.


## PlatONE's Consensus algorithm

PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm is a highly optimized BFT consensus algorithm, which could tolerate up to 1/3 of faulty nodes. While preserving the key characteristic of instant finality, the consensus algorithm extremely improves the system's decentralization. It is ensured that blocks are final, which means that there are no forks and any valid block must be somewhere in the main chain.

PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm can support up to 100 validators.  Compared with other BFT consensus algorithm,  our consensus algorithm markedly improves the performance. Our tests show that the system could have near to 1000 tps when the consensus  node count is 10.

Consensus related parameters can be configured easily as desired, and the validator set can be dynamically updated. Importantly it is planned in the near future that the consensus algorithm can be pluggable and auditable. 

PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm runs in round. In a specific round, a proposer is selected according to the selection policy, which could be currently round robin and sticky proposer.

The validators run the consensus algorithm to consensus for the block proposed by the proposer. It is a 3-phase consensus, while the last two phases are voting phases which provide the Safety property. PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm leverages the round change mechanism together with the block locking mechanism to provide the Liveness property. Importantly, PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm fixes the inherent issue of block locking mechanism of some famous blockchain projects. The issue could lead to loss of Liveness of the consensus.

PlatONE‘s Consensus algorithm will generate consensus proof for every block in the blockchain. The consensus proof consists of the committed seals from the validators, which makes blocks be self-verifiable and light client can be supported as well.

## Privilege Model

Privilege model in PlatONE includes three modules according to different objects in the system. Since these objects, such as user accounts, nodes and contracts, have different behaviors, we design user account management, node management and contract firewall modules to control the privilege in our system.

+ Role Management 

  According to different user privileges, PlatONE sets various user roles, and manage these roles through system contracts. 

  In the system, users could be appointed as different roles for privileges. 

  Currently there are 5 roles for users:

  Permission for each role is as follows:

+ Node Management

  In PlatONE, nodes are controlled by node management contract, and only the chainCreator, chainAdmin and nodeAdmin could update nodes data in system contract. Thus,  to add nodes, update node, or delete nodes, only accounts with these roles could invoke node management contracts to perform above operations.Note that nodeAdmins can only manage the nodes that they have added, chainCreator and chainAdmins can manage all nodes.

+ Contract Firewall

  Contract Invocation permission is controlled by contract firewall in PlatONE, only the creator of contract can set the corresponding contract firewall.

  Contract firewall includes filter rules for each contract interface to achieve access control on interface level, which is implemented by the following two lists.

  - ACCEPT LIST:  the list of accepted address for the corresponding interface, namely whitelist.
  - REJECT LIST:  the list of rejected address for the corresponding interface, namely blacklist.
